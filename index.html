        <h1>2 INSPIRATION STORY ABOUT SWIMMNG </h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <h2>1.Olympian Refugee Yusra Mardini
        </h2>
        <p>Despite living in a war zone, Yusra Mardini has stuck to her passion for swimming. It’s a passion that she has cultivated since she was three, with one of her parents being a swim instructor. After representing Syria in the 2012 FINA World Swimming Championships, she has been struggling to keep up with her training due to the civil war. She has even trained in pools that were bombed, leaving the roofs partially exposed.To continue her swimming dreams, Yusra fled from Syria to Greece, via Turkey. However, in a tragic turn of events, her boat started sinking in the middle of the Aegean sea with 20 people on board. She hopped into treacherous waters, with three other swimmers, to push the boat to land. Those four hours proved to be a true fight for survival. 2 years after that fateful day, Yusra won her 100m butterfly heat at the Rio 2016 Olympics and is now. an official UN ambassador. Her story is definitely one for the books(literally, too) and has inspired many to keep chasing their swimming dreams.</p>
        <h3>2.Singapore’s Olympic Gold Medalist — Joseph Schooling
        </h3>
        <p>As Yusra’s story may seem a little far-fetched, we have to mention a story that hits close to home. Yes, you know who we are talking about. It’s the one and only Joseph Schooling. Born and raised in Singapore, he was inspired by his uncle, Lloyd Valberg, the first high jumper athlete who competed for the nation at the 1948 Olympics.He subsequently proved his mettle by setting records in local competitions and left our shores to train overseas. In spite of frequent homesickness as a young teenager, and huge financial sacrifices required from his family, amounting up to more than a million dollars, he continued to perform under pressure for the most part.A last minute change to his goggles threw him off his stride at the London Olympics but as all champions do, he continued to fight for glory. Coming back stronger than ever, he made steady wins at SEA and Commonwealth games before bringing home the gold at the Rio Olympics. As his story shows, resilience and hard work truly pays off.
